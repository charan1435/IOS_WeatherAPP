# IOS_WeatherAPP
This repository contains a Swift iOS application built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. The project was developed using Xcode and follows best practices in separating business logic, UI, and data handling to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Note: Due to the unavailability of a personal macOS device, the project was developed using a friend's MacBook. This is the reason for the change in the macOS username and any associated repository naming inconsistencies. Additionally, instead of pushing the code directly via Git, the final submission has been made as a zipped project archive.
